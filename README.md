Sublime Text Snippets for Joomla! 3.x
=====================================

This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing CMS Joomla! 3.x development.

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install Joomla! 3.x Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Add Repository", then input this repository url. Reopen the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for Joomla! 3.x Snippets.

### Without Package Control ###

If you have not got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder, like so:
